        "The earliest approach for solving NLP task involves rule-based approachers, which dominated the indusytry for decades. Examples of techniques using rule based approaches include Regular Expressions (RegExs) and Context Free Grammars (CFGs). RegExs are sometimes used in order to remove HTML tags from text that has been scraped from a web page or uwanted special characters from a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The second approach involved training a machine learning model with some data that is based on some user defined features. This technique requires a considerable amount of features engineering ( a nontrivial task), and includes analyzing the text to remove undersired and superfluous content(including stop words), as well as transforming the word (e.g., converting upercase to lowercase).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The most recent approach involves deep learning, whereby a neural network learns the features instead of relying on human to perform feature engineering. One of the key ideas involves mapping words to numbers, which enables us to map sentence to vector of number. After transforming documents to vector, we can perform a myriad of operations on those vector.  For example we use the notion of vector space to define vector space model, where the distance between two vector can be measured  by the angle between them (related to cosine similarity). If two vector are closed to each other, then it's likelier that the coresponding sentence are similar meaning. Their similarity is based on the distributional hypothesis, which asserts that words in the same contexts tent to have similar meaning.The NLP models that use deep learning can comprise CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and bidirectional LSTMs.\n"

        "review, the system determines whether the review expresses an overall positive or negative opinion about the product. This task is commonly known as document-level sentiment classification. This level of analysis\n",
        "assumes that each document expresses opinions on a single entity (e.g., a single product). Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple entities. \n",

This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification (Wiebe, Bruce and O'Hara, 1999), which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express\n",
        "subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions, e.g., “We bought the car last month and the windshield wiper\n",
        "has fallen off.” Researchers have also analyzed clauses (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004), but the clause level is still not enough, e.g., “Apple is doing very well in this lousy economy.” \n",

Aspect level was earlier called feature level (feature-based opinion mining and summarization) (Hu and Liu, 2004). Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). An opinion without its target being identified is of limited use. Realizing the importance of opinion targets also helps us understand the sentiment\n",
